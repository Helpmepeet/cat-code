TASK CONTRACT: Perform a reflective pass over the memory files and consolidate recent signal into durable, well-organized memories so future sessions can orient quickly.

Memory directory: \`${memoryRoot}\`
${DIR_EXISTS_GUIDANCE}

Session transcripts: \`${transcriptDir}\` (large JSONL files — grep narrowly, do not read whole files)

---

## Phase 1 — Orient

Complete this phase before moving to Phase 2.

- \`ls\` the memory directory to see what already exists
- Read \`${ENTRYPOINT_NAME}\` to understand the current index
- Skim existing topic files so you improve them rather than creating duplicates
- If \`logs/\` or \`sessions/\` subdirectories exist (assistant-mode layout), review recent entries there

## Phase 2 — Gather recent signal

Do not start Phase 3 until Phase 2 is complete.

Look for new information worth persisting. Sources in rough priority order:

1. **Daily logs** (\`logs/YYYY/MM/YYYY-MM-DD.md\`) if present — these are the append-only stream
2. **Existing memories that drifted** — facts that contradict something you see in the codebase now
3. **Transcript search** — if you need specific context (for example, "what was the error message from yesterday's build failure?"), grep the JSONL transcripts for narrow terms:
   \`grep -rn "<narrow term>" ${transcriptDir}/ --include="*.jsonl" | tail -50\`

Do not exhaustively read transcripts. Look only for things you already suspect matter.

## Phase 3 — Consolidate

Do not start Phase 4 until Phase 3 is complete.

For each thing worth remembering, write or update a memory file at the top level of the memory directory. Use the memory file format and type conventions from your system prompt's auto-memory section — that is the source of truth for what to save, how to structure it, and what NOT to save.

Focus on:
- Merging new signal into existing topic files rather than creating near-duplicates
- Converting relative dates ("yesterday", "last week") to absolute dates so they remain interpretable after time passes
- Deleting contradicted facts — if today's investigation disproves an old memory, fix it at the source

## Phase 4 — Prune and index

Update \`${ENTRYPOINT_NAME}\` so it stays under ${MAX_ENTRYPOINT_LINES} lines AND under ~25KB. It is an **index**, not a dump — each entry should be one line under ~150 characters: \`- [Title](file.md) — one-line hook\`. Never write memory content directly into it.

- Remove pointers to memories that are now stale, wrong, or superseded
- Demote verbose entries: if an index line is over ~200 chars, it is carrying content that belongs in the topic file — shorten the line and move the detail
- Add pointers to newly important memories
- Resolve contradictions — if two files disagree, fix the wrong one

## Output contract

After the file work is complete, return a brief summary that states what you consolidated, updated, or pruned. If nothing changed because the memories are already tight, say so plainly.${extra ? `\n\n## Additional context\n\n${extra}` : ''}`
  }

  return `# Dream: Memory Consolidation

You are performing a dream — a reflective pass over your memory files. Synthesize what you've learned recently into durable, well-organized memories so that future sessions can orient quickly.
