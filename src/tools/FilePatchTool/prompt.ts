Use the \`Apply_patch\` tool to edit files.
Your patch language is a stripped\u2011down, file\u2011oriented diff format designed to be easy to parse and safe to apply. You can think of it as a high\u2011level envelope:

*** Begin Patch
[ one or more file sections ]
*** End Patch

Within that envelope, you get a sequence of file operations.
You MUST include a header to specify the action you are taking.
Each operation starts with one of three headers:

*** Add File: <path> - create a new file. Every following line is a + line (the initial contents).
*** Delete File: <path> - remove an existing file. Nothing follows.
*** Update File: <path> - patch an existing file in place (optionally with a rename).

May be immediately followed by *** Move to: <new path> if you want to rename the file.
Then one or more "hunks", each introduced by @@ (optionally followed by a hunk header).
Within a hunk each line starts with:

For instructions on [context_before] and [context_after]:
- By default, show 3 lines of code immediately above and 3 lines immediately below each change. If a change is within 3 lines of a previous change, do NOT duplicate the first change's [context_after] lines in the second change's [context_before] lines.
- If 3 lines of context is insufficient to uniquely identify the snippet of code within the file, use the @@ operator to indicate the class or function to which the snippet belongs. For instance, we might have:
@@ class BaseClass
[3 lines of pre-context]
- [old_code]
+ [new_code]
[3 lines of post-context]

- If a code block is repeated so many times in a class or function such that even a single \`@@\` statement and 3 lines of context cannot uniquely identify the snippet of code, you can use multiple \`@@\` statements to jump to the right context. For instance:

@@ class BaseClass
@@ \t def method():
[3 lines of pre-context]
- [old_code]
+ [new_code]
[3 lines of post-context]

The full grammar definition is below:
Patch := Begin { FileOp } End
Begin := "*** Begin Patch" NEWLINE
End := "*** End Patch" NEWLINE
FileOp := AddFile | DeleteFile | UpdateFile
AddFile := "*** Add File: " path NEWLINE { "+" line NEWLINE }
DeleteFile := "*** Delete File: " path NEWLINE
UpdateFile := "*** Update File: " path NEWLINE [ MoveTo ] { Hunk }
MoveTo := "*** Move to: " newPath NEWLINE
Hunk := "@@" [ header ] NEWLINE { HunkLine } [ "*** End of File" NEWLINE ]
HunkLine := (" " | "-" | "+") text NEWLINE

A full patch can combine several operations:

*** Begin Patch
*** Add File: src/hello.ts
+export const HELLO = 'world'
*** Update File: src/app.ts
*** Move to: src/main.ts
@@ function greet() {
-  console.log('Hi')
+  console.log('Hello, world!')
*** Delete File: src/obsolete.ts
*** End Patch

It is important to remember:

- You must include a header with your intended action (Add/Delete/Update)
- You must prefix new lines with \`+\` even when creating a new file
- File references can only be relative, NEVER ABSOLUTE.
- Patch paths resolve relative to the current session working directory.
- In the main session, a foreground Bash command updates that directory to the command's final \`pwd\`. Later tools, including \`Apply_patch\`, use the updated directory even though shell state does not persist.
- In agent threads, a \`cd\` applies only to the current Bash call and does not change the thread's assigned patch base.`
